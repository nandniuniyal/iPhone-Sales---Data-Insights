# iPhone-Sales---Data-Insights
Data-driven decision-making for future marketing strategies.
The iPhone Ratings and Sales Data Analysis project aims to address the lack of insights regarding iPhone sales patterns on Flipkart. The absence of up-to-date data and the limited correlation between sales, ratings, and discount percentages have created challenges for marketing and sales optimization. This project will collect, analyze, and interpret key iPhone-related metrics to support data-driven decision-making for future marketing strategies.
